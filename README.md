# Resume-Screening

•	A typical job posting on the Internet receives a massive number of applications within a short window of time.
•	Manually filtering of resumes time consuming and incurs huge costs.
•	We devised a solution that matches the resumes with the given JD.
•	Using NLP techniques we extract the relevant information from the unstructured resume.
•	The solution employs vectorization and uses Cosine Similarity to match each resume with JD and gives out a score of match for each candidate.
